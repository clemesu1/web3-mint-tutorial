# Basic Web3 Minit Website

This project demostrates a sinple Web3 minting website using React, Hardhat, and Ethers. It comes with a mint example contract, a script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

The tutorial I followed can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBudoefuKBk).

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

To run the application:

```shell
npm start
```
